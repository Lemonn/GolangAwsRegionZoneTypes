# Info

Unofficial Golang (Enum) Types for all AWS Regions and Zones. Types are fetched twice a day from AWS and updated 
whenever a new Region or Zone is added. Zones and Regions are only added, never removed. Whenever new Regions or 
Zones are added, a new version will be released.

If you want to run your own version, you can find the code that updates this repo here: https://github.com/Lemonn/RegionAzGenerator
